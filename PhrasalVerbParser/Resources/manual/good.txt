rush away|Okay, part one starts back in 1929 when the great astronomer Edwin Hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushing away from us, establishing that space itself is stretching, it's expanding.
slow down|But even so, there was one thing that everyone was certain of: The expansion must be slowing down.
slow down|Here's the surprise: They found that the expansion is not slowing down.
speed up|Instead they found that it's speeding up, going faster and faster.
rush away|What force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever-quickening speed?
slow down|Because the repulsive gravity of an invisible energy in space -- we now call it dark energy, but I've made it smokey white here so you can see it -- its repulsive gravity would cause each galaxy to push against every other, driving expansion to speed up, not slow down.
speed up|Because the repulsive gravity of an invisible energy in space -- we now call it dark energy, but I've made it smokey white here so you can see it -- its repulsive gravity would cause each galaxy to push against every other, driving expansion to speed up, not slow down.
account for|When the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up, look at what they found.
speed up|When the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up, look at what they found.
allow for|It has internal inconsistencies, unless we allow for something wholly unfamiliar -- extra dimensions of space.
use up|The fuel is based on something called a quantum field, but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that it's virtually impossible to use it all up, which means in the inflationary theory, the Big Bang giving rise to our universe is likely not a one-time event.
speed up|You see, we learned that our universe is not static, that space is expanding, that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully examining faint pinpoints of starlight coming to us from distant galaxies.
rush away|But because the expansion is speeding up, in the very far future, those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast that we won't be able to see them -- not because of technological limitations, but because of the laws of physics.

clean off|It's what the dentist cleans off your teeth every time that you go in for a visit.
build up|But in ancient times before tooth brushing, up to 600 milligrams might have built up on the teeth over a lifetime.
focus on|And so previous studies had only focused on microscopy.
churn out|So what started out as an idea, is now being implemented to churn out millions of sequences that we can use to investigate the long-term evolutionary history of human health and disease, right down to the genetic code of individual pathogens.
hear about|You hear about it all the time.
hear about|You hear about it on your television sets.
hear about|Sometimes I'm concerned that we hear about it so much that we've come to accept longer lives with a kind of a complacency, even ease.
embark on|Years ago, my colleagues and I embarked on a study where we followed the same group of people over a 10-year period.
ask about|But as social scientists, we continue to ask about possible alternatives.
soak up|When time horizons are long and nebulous, as they typically are in youth, people are constantly preparing, trying to soak up all the information they possibly can, taking risks, exploring.
end in|The problem with these patents is that the mechanisms are obscure and the patent system is dysfunctional, and as a result, most of these lawsuits end in settlements.
team up|Now I had hoped to team up with some of these larger companies in order to defend against this lawsuit, but one-by-one they settled out of the case, even though -- and this is important -- none of these companies infringed on this patent -- not a one of them.
boil down|Well to sum up, it boils down to one thing: Don't negotiate with terrorists.

plow back|They plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits.

And I said, "I don't study men." And he said, "That's convenient." And I said, "Why?" And he said, "Because you say to reach out, tell our story, be vulnerable.
