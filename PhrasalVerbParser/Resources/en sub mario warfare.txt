INVASION DAY 
Lord Bowser… 
Our spies believe the King is still within the palace walls.
As well as the princess.
And what of her bodyguard?
We have a score to settle.
Leave him to me.
Very well.
Let the invasion begin!
Command we have a red alert- 
Secure the roof!
Overwatch in place.
Rooftop secure.
Grenade!
Move out.
Clear.
Eastwing: secure.
Guard is down.
They're somewhere here.
Smoke 'em out!
It’s Bravo Team… 
Something doesn't feel right here...
…There should be more guys to shoot.
What if it's a trap?
Oh, you think everything's a trap.
Oh shit, it's Toad!
Take him out- 
Your Majesty.
Princess.
Let's go.
Stay close.
Stop right th- 
Wait wait wait!
Don't shoot!
Don’t shoot!
Your majesty… 
We're completely surrounded.
I don't see another option but surrender.
Toad, is there another escape route?
There's a ventilation pipe at the end of the maintenance hall.
But it's too small for a man to fit through.
No….
Princess… 
I need you to go with Toad now.
No, dad I'm not gonna leave you.
My beautiful daughter….
Sometimes a princess has to do what is right for her kingdom….
…as does a king.
This has been in our family for generations.
As long as you wear it… 
I will be with you… 
...keeping you safe.
Then you keep it….you stay safe.
I love you my daughter.
Never forget that.
I love you.
Toad.
You majesty… 
It's been my greatest honor…to serve with you.
Princess…we need to go.
Come on… 
Princess, let’s go… Run!
Your orders sire?
We know what Bowser does with prisoners.
We won't be giving him any.
We fight to the end.
For the kingdom.
For the kingdom!
Still no sign of the target.
Bowser's gonna be pissed.
Bill's coming down.
Wait here.
Aw crap, that's just what we need.
Tell me where the girl is and I might let you live.
OK, you can go- 
Princess, come on.
I have an idea.
Um….Toad?
Alright.
Off you go, Princess.
Toad… 
What's going to happen to you?
Don't worry about me Princess.
Just get to the end of the pipe and keep going.
Don't let anyone know who you are 
If I get out of here alive, I'll find you.
I promise!
Now go!
Bill.
Toad.
Now there won't be any question of who's the fastest gun in the mushroom kingdom.
There never was.
You never did know when to quit, Toad.
Not so fast!
This… 
…is from the Princess.
AGHHHHHHH!!!!
ONE WEEK BEFORE INVASION DAY 
RESERVE FORCES ARE SETTING UP CHECKPOINTS IN MUSHROOM CITY AS TROOPS GATHER AT THE BORDER.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO BRING YOU NEWS AS BOWSER'S AGRESSION 
MOVES CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM.
This war…it's bad for business.
We should be out there…fighting!
With what, our plungers?
Nah, we should join the army.
I mean, haven't you ever every wanted to be anything more than a plumber?
Hey!
I'm proud of being a plumber.
I mean, somebody's gotta fix these toilets!
You don't get it, do you, Mario!?
If Bowser wins this war, there won’t be any toilets left to fix.
Look.
There ain’t nothing wrong with being plumbers.
But this is our chance to be heroes….
Private Mario!
Private Luigi!
Command has seen fit to send you on a special mission!
People of the Mushroom Kingdom…..
